When traffic is heavy, critical response times could be shortened by putting the rec-
ommended smart traffic management system into practice. In the past, manual methods
were insufficient to control traffic as needed. The number of cars on the road today is too
many for the infrastructure that currently exists. In metropolitan areas, this problem af-
fects a larger population. A lot of research has been performed on traffic management
employing the intelligent approach of using traffic data to determine the state of the green
light. Intelligent traffic control is a broad topic, and Table 1 lists the methods that have
been used recently.Vehicles2023,5 1847

A preemption timer is initiated as the green light is extended to track how long it
remains on. The system switches back to its standard green light cycle after the preemp-
tion period is up, allowing other directions to pass through the intersection. After the or-
dinary traffic light cycle, the system resumes regular functioning until the next emergency
vehicle is detected. Throughout this whole process, the primary thread is monitoring how
long the current green signal will last. The algorithm determines the next signal, which
turns green for the predetermined period when the green timer on the current signal hits
zero. Based on the percentage of each class of vehicles that were present at a signal and
considering the typical beginning speeds, ambulance detection, and acceleration times of
cars, the right green signal time was chosen. The following step is to use Equation (5) to
calculate the time until the traffic light turns green.

4.3. Simulation Results and Analysis
The suggested adaptive traffic light control system built with Pygame and the adap-
tive traffic signal system built with SUMO were both evaluated in a real-time setting with
the same amount of time (300 s). In this research, average vehicle throughput was com-
pared with a system built using SUMO. Ten simulations of both adaptive systems, each
lasting 5 min, were run side by side to comprehensively compare the results of the two
systems. A performance indicator was the number of cars that could cross the intersection
in a certain period. This has an impact on both the length of other signal waits, as well as
vehicle wait times. Multiple vehicles passing in opposite directions and the total number
of passing vehicles were used to tabulate the data.

(c) Results Analysis
All 10 simulations with different traffic density, when comparing the results on the
traffic throughput, shows that the suggested technique is more effective than the adaptive
traffic light using SUMO. Emergency vehicles also spend less time at traffic intersections
thanks to emergency vehicle detection in real time using the 2D-CNN model and time
adjustment algorithm used in this system. The graph shows the two systemsʹ performance
at each simulation using the data in Tables 5 and 6, which were generated during the sim-
ulation of traffic lights using Pygame and SUMO, as shown in Figure 13.Vehicles2023,5 1860

hardware design for this project has been saved for future use. The initiative could be
expanded in the future to improve traffic management and reduce congestion. The detec-
tion of accidents or malfunctions is a feature that can be added to improve the project.
Because a variety of risky situations, such as angle and left-turn crashes, occur frequently
at intersections, they are more likely to result in catastrophic accidents. To save lives and
damage, as well as reduce traffic and delays, it is crucial to detect accidents accurately and
quickly at junctions. This can be performed by filtering out parked cars and identifying
cars that are stopped for an extended amount of time in an uncomfortable place, like the
middle of the road. Additionally, vehicles that break traffic laws can be found. Setting a
violation line and taking a snapshot when it is crossed while the signal is red may allow
for the detection of cars that are running red lights in an image or video feed. Techniques
for image processing can help with this. Syncing traffic lights at different crossings will
benefit commuters since once a car enters the roadway, there may be less pause, and emer-
gency vehicles can be detected at any point in time to be given priority, not only when
they approach the traffic intersection. Also, if emergency vehicles arrive from all direc-
tions, the system can be improved to handle situations in which an algorithm calculates
the arrival time and urgency of each emergency vehicle and allows that particular emer-
gency vehicle to go first.
